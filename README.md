# Civilization Master

The goal of this project is to provide useful tools for both players and translators of Sid Meier's Civilization series. The project aims to make it easier to play the games in any language.

Since this project is still in it's early phase a lot of this is still uncertain and plans may change.


## First release planned features for Civilization V:

1. Install fixed English (technical fixes + Community Patch)
2. Install new languages not shipped with the game (Finnish, Brazilian portuguese, others if there are)
3. Tool for fixing Mod localizations in non-English languages
4. Import game and Mod languages
5. Manage Mod language dependencies
6. Basic localization tools: view strings, compare languages, edit strings
7. Export XML language packs in various formats (`Assets` or `Text` directory compatible variants)
8. Support new JSON format
